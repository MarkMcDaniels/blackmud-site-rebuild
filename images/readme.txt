PLAYABLE RACES

--- Half Orc Description ---
Half-orcs are a milder version of their orcish parent. They are usually born of human mothers and orcish fathers. Half-orc children born to orcish mothers, tend to have very short lives. Half-orcs for the most part appear as deformed humans. They often have broad, flat faces, jagged teeth, slightly grayish skin coloring and more body hair than a normal human.




NON-PLAYABLE RACES

--- Gralner Description ---
Gralner appear to be the cross between a humanoid and an animal. Their appearance is an odd combination of feline and lupine characteristics. Males tend more toward the lupine, while females tend more toward feline.

--- Wep Description ---
The wep are from a completely different evolutionary branch than the other sentient races of Entia. They appear to be the cross between a fish and a human, but there is nothing human about them. Their bodies are anthropomorphous in limb, but have a long, thick tail, webbed fingers and toes tipped with small claws. They have two large lid-less eyes and their mouths are small but have hundreds small sharp teeth.
