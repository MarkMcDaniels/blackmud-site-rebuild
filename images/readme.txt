PLAYABLE RACES



--- Mirlad ---
Mirlad are the result of inter-breeding between elves and dwarves. They tend to be of dwarven height and of elven-build and have the thick course hair of dwarves. They have both the tensile strength of dwarven musculature and the agility of the elven frame. Roughly half of mirlad inherit the acute vision of their elven parent.



--- Half Orc Description ---
Half-orcs are a milder version of their orcish parent. They are usually born of human mothers and orcish fathers. Half-orc children born to orcish mothers, tend to have very short lives. Half-orcs for the most part appear as deformed humans. They often have broad, flat faces, jagged teeth, slightly grayish skin coloring and more body hair than a normal human.



--- Ogre ---
Ogres strongly resemble their orcish fathers, but are enormous in size. They average nearly eight feet in height. Their limbs are thick and knotted with muscle, and are easily as strong as female giants.

NON-PLAYABLE RACES

--- Orcs Description ---
Orcs are of similar size to humans with broad flat faces. They have thick, course hair which also grows along the neck and upper half of their spines. Their skins is thick, rough and greyish in color. Orcs have dozens of small sharp teeth.



--- Gralner Description ---
Gralner appear to be the cross between a humanoid and an animal. Their appearance is an odd combination of feline and lupine characteristics. Males tend more toward the lupine, while females tend more toward feline.



--- Wep Description ---
The wep are from a completely different evolutionary branch than the other sentient races of Entia. They appear to be the cross between a fish and a human, but there is nothing human about them. Their bodies are anthropomorphous in limb, but have a long, thick tail, webbed fingers and toes tipped with small claws. They have two large lid-less eyes and their mouths are small but have hundreds small sharp teeth.



--- Tarr Description ---
The tarr are the newest race to the face of Entia. They are believed to be an odd mixing of ogre and human, and to have come into existance through magic. They breed faster than their distant cousins the orcs, but have extremely short life spans. It is uncommon for a tarr to live beyond thirty years. Tarr are slightly larger than humans on average and are extremely strong for their size. They have a greyish tint to their skin and their teeth are usually small and jagged.

Tarr live exclusively in the Red Ridge Mountains, south of Gartome and north of Nera Valley. The tarr nation is made up of a loosely knit confederation of tribes. Each tribe is led by a triumvirate made up of a warrior chief, a high priest and a chaotic mage. The most powerful tribe leads the confederation. The various tribes are often at war with each other. Occassionally the tribes will cooperate enough to launch raids on western Makilor or northern Bayse.

The tarr worship the gods of chaos and their short lives are spent engendering as much chaos as they can. Tarr are extremely dangerous and unpredictable. Needless to say tarr are not welcome in the domains of other races. 



--- Gorboc Description ---
Gorbocs - Size: Medium

    Overview: Gorbocs are slightly smaller and slimmer than standard Orcs but exhibit a higher level of intelligence. They possess the same thick, course hair on their necks and spines. Their skin is also thick and rough, but more brownish in color. They have small, sharp teeth, acute night vision, and a keen sense of smell. Also, like Orcs, they have highly developed immune systems and heal very quickly. Unlike other Orcs, Gorbloc can manipulate chaos and are known to have both mages and clerics, although it is not known how Gorbocs learn their arcane skills.

    World Context: They appear to be less xenophobic than other bestial races, preferring to hide rather than attack if possible. Like other bestial races, Gorbocs have become increasingly active in the world for some unknown reason. Gorbocs have even recently been seen in the presence of other Orcs, which is unusual.
