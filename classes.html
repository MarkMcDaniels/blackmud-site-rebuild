                            Warriors are known to have more strength than the average player. This makes them better at hand-to-hand-combat as they possess skills of violence and fighting unequaled by the members of any other class. However, they lack the ability to use magic of any sort.

                                The success of a bash depends upon how well you are learned. To bash someone is to attempt to knock that person over. If you succeed you will inflict minor damage, and cause the victim to fall on its rear. The victim will be unable to issue any commands for two rounds of violence. If you miss you loose your balance and fall. A bash makes you unable to type commands for two rounds of violence.

                                There are two kinds of disarm. Disarming weapons and disarming traps. If the player has the disarm weapon skill, and successfully uses it, the monster's weapon will fly from its hand/tentacle, etc. If the player has the disarm traps skill, one can attempt to disable a trap.. failure indicates a high probability that the trap will be sprung on the player attempting the disarm.

                                Dodge allows players to avoid the attacks of opponents. Note: this applies to physical attacks only.

                                This skill will enable you to hold a weapon in your hand and use it to attack. You must be good at either backstab or dodge to learn to dual wield.

Note: Weapon weight will affect the damage you deal when wielding two weapons. A two handed weapon's damage will be affected when you are holding a second weapon. Also, ambidextrous individuals have a better chance of being successful at their secondary attack than others.

                                The success of a kick depends upon how well you are learned. The higher level you reach the harder you kick. There is one small catch - whenever you kick (or miss) you will be unable to type any command for three rounds of 'Violence' - so be sure that you do not need to flee! This is one of the Monks most awesome weapons. Use it wisely.

                                A rescue is an attempt to make a monster hit you instead of the person being rescued. You can only 'turn' one monster for each attempt. This is highly useful when playing in groups.

                                Allows a fighter or monk to get out of combat without having to panic and flee. If you make the roll, you WILL leave the room, and you lose no exp for doing it. This skill gets better through use. This skill does not have a name of its own, but is built in to the 'flee' command.

                                With this spell, the cleric calls upon the raw power of their diety to smite differently aligned people. This is a VERY hostilespell capable of wreaking great devastation of disbelievers. This spellis an area of affect one, and as such, all non-grouped people will be subjectedto it. Neutral clerics will affect both evil and good victims, good clericswill only affect evil victims and evils clerics will only affect the good.If the victims falls within one of those parameters they are considereda valid target. Should the target be an extra-planar being, they will bedestroyed and their spirit banished to their home plane. If the victimis not an extra-planar being then the affect of the word is dependant onthe level difference of the caster and the victim. Should this level differencebe greater than 30, the victim will be utterly destroyed by the clericsshow of power. Should this difference be greated than 20, the victim willbe damaged for the difference * 3 points of damage, they will be blindedand paralyzed (in awe, no doubt) for a period no longer than the caster'slevel divided by 10. The difference be greater than 10, the victim willbe damaged the difference * 2 hitpoints and will be silenced and blindedfor a period not to exceed the caster's level divided by 10. Should thedifference only be somewhere between 1 to 9, the cleric's word will knockthe victim on their butt and blind them for a period not to exceed thecaster's level divided by 10. If the caster is actually of lower levelthan the target, this spell will just piss the victim off.

                                    Druids are the guardians of nature. They remain neutral with regard to other concerns. They develop resistance and sometimes immunity to charm, poison, electricity, cold and fire. If a druid strays from the path (i.e.: is no longer neutral) they will slowly loose their ability to cast spells. The farther they stray from neutrality, the harder it is for them to cast spells.

                                                This spell causes the victim to gain speed resulting in more attacks. It also ages the victim due to the immense physical strain on the body. Mobiles generally don't like the strain. If the mage uses this spell on themself, they are able to resist the aging affect.

                                        Monks are masters of harmony. They are very aware of their internal balance and are resistant to things that upset that balance. This characteristic does not necessarily force them to be neutral. Over time their training enables them to attack others with their bare hands and to kick things with amazing force. Their focus on their being neutralizes any affect dexterity would normally have on their armor class. Very little is reflex anymore. As they become more powerful they become resistant and eventually immune to things that would disturb their internal balance. These include poison, haste, charm, slow, and paralyze. By 11th level a monk is already immune to haste, slow and paralyze. At 15th level they develop a resistance to poison which turns into an immunity at 32nd. At18th level they are resistant to charm. At 36th level they are immune to it. Monks are designed to be weak and equipment starved at low levels. At high levels they rival warriors. They are doomed to poverty at lower levels and restricted from saving money, but may prosper after proving their worth at higher levels.

                                        Thieves are known to have very special qualities, that no other class offers. Many of these qualities can come in handy in many situations, such as picking locks. They are not very combat oriented, however, so do not expect to be able to kill many things by yourself. The useful aspect of thieves involves their ability to scout ahead, avoiding monsters, detecting and removing traps and selling and buying items at the black market.

                                                    Is a way to sneak up on a person, and attempt to place your dagger in his back, at exactly the point where it does most damage. A successful backstab gives a damage multiplier, depending on level. Levels 1 - 7: x2 Levels 8 -15: x3 Levels 16-24: x4 Levels 25-32: x5 Levels 33-38: x6 Levels 39-43: x7 Levels 44-48: x8 Level 49 : x9 Level 50 : x10

Now for the nitty gritty stuff. Sneaking does help you backstab. You always have to be sneaking to backstab aggressive creature. In order to backstab a huge creature you have to be flying and you will not do as much damage. Certain races like slimes, ghosts, undead, are not very affected by backstabbing. In order to backstab, you need to make a successful skill check, and then a successful to-hit check. Backstab damage is figured out my multiplying your weapon damage, INCLUDING your plusses to damage by your multiplier. Your multiplier is modified depending on how well you know your victim's innards. This knowledge is reflected in various lores taught to you by the LoreMaster. Your base multiplier is determined by your level and can be determined on the above chart. If you were attempting to backstab a humanoid, a check is made with your "people lore" skill. Numerically, this ammounts to the following: If I am not-learned (learned = 0) then my multiplier is multiplied by .1 ( (how learned + 10) / 100). So, this pretty much nukes my multiplier. If I am learned at Superb (95) then my multiplier is multiplied by 1.05 ( (95 + 10) / 100) and my multiplier all hunky dory. Your lore will improve via multiple uses of backstab, of course which lore is improved depends on what you backstab.

Note: Weapon weight will affect the damage you deal when wielding two weapons. A two handed weapon's damage will be affected when you are holding a second weapon. Also, ambidextrous individuals have a better chance of being successful at their secondary attack than others.
